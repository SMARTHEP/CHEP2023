\abstract{%
\textbf{S}ynergies between \textbf{MA}chine learning, \textbf{R}eal-\textbf{T}ime analysis and \textbf{H}ybrid architectures for efficient \textbf{E}vent \textbf{P}rocessing and decision making (SMARTHEP) is a European Training Network with the aim of training a new generation of Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) to advance real-time decision-making, driving data-collection and analysis towards synonymity.\par

SMARTHEP will bring together scientists from the four major LHC collaborations which have been driving the development of real-time analysis (RTA) and key specialists from computer science and industry. By solving concrete problems as a community, SMARTHEP will further the use of RTA techniques, enabling future HEP discoveries and generating impact in industry.\par

The ESRs will contribute to European growth, leveraging their hands-on experience in machine learning and accelerators towards commercial deliverables in fields that can profit most from RTA, e.g. transport, manufacturing, and finance.\par

This contribution presents the training and outreach plan for the network, and is intended as an opportunity for further collaboration and feedback from the CHEP community.
