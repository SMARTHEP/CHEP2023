\section{Network outcomes}
\label{outcomes}
As discussed in Section~\ref{esrs}, each ESR position centres upon a set of well-defined outcomes .

\subsection{Goals of HEP and industry}
\label{goals}

\subsection{RTA whitepapers}
\label{whitepapers}
As a deliverable of the network, the participants will write a series of whitepapers reviewing the current RTA state-of-the-art. The four whitepaper topics are listed in the following subsections and an overview is given for each. These whitepapers are expected to be published by the end of 2023.

\subsubsection{ML for RTA}
\label{wp-ML-for-RTA}
A summary of ML for RTA; focusing on SMARTHEP use cases/best practices for ML in HEP.

\subsubsection{Hybrid architectures at the LHC}
\label{wp-hybrid-architectures-LHC}
The use of hybrid architectures by LHC experiments is reviewed in the second whitepaper, 

\subsubsection{Trigger and data acquisition systems of the LHC}
\label{wp-TDAQ-at-LHC}
In the third whitepaper, a review of the triggers of LHC experiments is made, with a focus on best practices for software in RTA applications.

\subsubsection{RTA techniques at LHC experiments}
\label{wp-RTA-at-LHC}
This whitepaper focuses on the use of RTA techniques at LHC experiments, in particular in the context of RTA-based searches and anomaly.


\subsection{Training of ESRs}
\label{training}
Funding is allocated within the network for ESRs to attend relevant training activities, as laid out in their PCDP. Such 

\subsection{Software and digital assets}
\label{software}
The work of the ESRs will generate a number of digital assets (e.g. software packages, data processing tools), with many being applicable beyond narrow academic/industrial applications. 

\subsubsection{Commitment to Open and FAIR principles}
\label{open-FAIR}
The network is committed to producing making any produced digital assets \textbf{F}indable, \textbf{A}ccessible, \textbf{I}nteroperable, and \textbf{R}eusable (FAIR) \cite{FAIR-principles}. Under these guiding principles\par
Additionally, our assets and results should be open and accessible to the wider community. To implement these commitments, a project on GitHub has been created to host such assets, \url{https://github.com/SMARTHEP}. Other assets and resources will be made available on the network website, \url{https://smarthep.org}.
