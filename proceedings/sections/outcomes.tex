\section{Network outcomes}
\label{outcomes}
The network is anchored by a set of concrete outcomes, guiding the progression of the network and its participants. These intended outcomes are summarised briefly below.

\subsection{Goals of HEP and industry}
\label{goals}
The core outcomes of the network are a set of goals, completed on behalf of the network partners by the network participants.  These goals include experiment commmissioning, HEP measurements and industrial results. These goals are typically defined with respect to a specific ESR position, e.g. the goal of ``calibration of ALICE TPC for heavy-ion physics'' associated to Joachim Hansen.

\subsection{RTA whitepapers}
\label{whitepapers}
Participants will write a series of three whitepapers reviewing the current RTA state-of-the-art, expected to be submmited in late 2023. These whitepapers will place a particular emphasis on the ongoing contributions of the network to their respective topics. \par

The first whitepaper reviews ML applications to HEP in RTA contexts and their corresponding best practices. Such applications range from data-taking, e.g. particle identification at ALICE, to offline analysis, e.g. anomaly detection for diject resonance searches at ATLAS. \cite{ALICE-PID, ATLAS-dijet} The use of hybrid architectures by LHC experiments is reviewed in the second whitepaper. Tasks such as selection and reconstruction were significantly accelerated during Run 2 of the LHC (2015-2018). Run 3 deployments of hybrid architectures capitalise on this progress, e.g. in the use of FPGAs in the ALICE Central Trigger System and the use of GPUs in the ATLAS High Level Trigger farm. \cite{ALICE-CTS, CMS-HLT-farm} In the third whitepaper, TDAQ systems of LHC experiments are reviewed, with a focus upon best practices for both TDAQ hardware and software. As such, this whitepaper reviews topics ranging from upgrades to the ATLAS TDAQ system, to the Allen framework of the LHCb experiment enabling software trigger operation at a 30~MHz readout rate. \cite{ATLAS-TDAQ, LHCb-Allen}

\subsection{Training of ESRs}
\label{training}
Funding is allocated within the network for participants to attend relevant training activities. In the case of ESRs, training and career devlopment is discussed in writing their respective PCDP, providing a clear overview of their intended and requested training activities. Examples of such activities include attendance of specialist industrial training sessions and academic schools. Training is also provided within the network, between participants, for example in the First SMARTHEP School on Collider Physics and Machine Learning discussed in Section~\ref{unige-school}.

\subsection{Software and digital assets}
\label{software}
The work of the ESRs will generate digital assets (e.g. software packages, data processing tools), with many being applicable beyond narrow academic/industrial applications. The network is therefore committed to making any such digital assets \textbf{F}indable, \textbf{A}ccessible, \textbf{I}nteroperable, and \textbf{R}eusable (FAIR). \cite{FAIR-principles} To implement these commitments, a project on GitHub has been created to host such assets, \url{https://github.com/SMARTHEP}. Other assets and resources will be made available on the network website, \url{https://smarthep.org}.
