\section{SMARTHEP as a European Training Network}
\label{network}
SMARTHEP is organised as a European Training Network, funded through the 2020 EU Horizon funding call. The primary aim of the network is to train 12 ESRs, whilst building synergies between HEP and industry. The network takes a novel approach to building such synergies, structuring each ESR position (a 3 year period of doctoral study) around secondments in both HEP and industry. To achieve this, the network is formed of a series of partnerships between universities, research institutes and organisations in industry, as listed in Table~\ref{partners}.

Each ESR \par
The network has a particular focus on physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Each ESR is thus affiliated to one of the four major experiments based at the LHC: ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. The network duration coincides with Run 3 of the LHC, 2022-2025. As such, ESR projects and outcomes have a focus on delivering required work for said experiments.

\subsection{Partnerships with industry}
\label{sec-2}
A unique feature of the network is the extensive cooperation between HEP and industry across all ESR positions. RTA approaches have seen significant adoption in industry in recent years, with many organisations turning to RTA as a means to handle ``big data''.
