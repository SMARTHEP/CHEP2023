\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
The \textbf{S}ynergies between \textbf{MA}chine learning, \textbf{R}eal-\textbf{T}ime analysis and \textbf{H}ybrid architectures for efficient \textbf{E}vent \textbf{P}rocessing and decision making (SMARTHEP) European Training Network is a European Union Horizon-funded training network, with a focus on the development of expertise in real-time analysis (RTA) techniques through their application to high energy physics (HEP) research and industry. The network centres around the training of 12 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs), with the network having commenced in September 2021 and concluding in September 2025. This contribution thus sets out the principles, approach and work of the SMARTHEP network.
