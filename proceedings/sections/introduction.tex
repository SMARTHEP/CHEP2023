The \textbf{S}ynergies between \textbf{MA}chine learning, \textbf{R}eal-\textbf{T}ime analysis and \textbf{H}ybrid architectures for efficient \textbf{E}vent \textbf{P}rocessing and decision making (SMARTHEP) European Training Network is a European Union Horizon-funded training network, with a focus on the real-time analysis techniques deployed in high energy physics research and in industry. The network centres around 12 doctoral students across Europe employed as Early Stage Researchers within the Marie Sk{\l}odowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) framework.
