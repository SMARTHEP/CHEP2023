The \textbf{S}ynergies between \textbf{MA}chine learning, \textbf{R}eal-\textbf{T}ime analysis and \textbf{H}ybrid architectures for efficient \textbf{E}vent \textbf{P}rocessing and decision making (SMARTHEP) European Training Network is a European Union Horizon-funded training network, with a focus on the real-time analysis techniques deployed in high energy physics (HEP) research and in industry. The network centres around 12 doctoral students across Europe employed as Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) within the Marie Sk{\l}odowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) framework. The network commenced in September 2021 and will conclude in September 2025, with each ESR position spanning the 3 years from September 2022 to September 2025.\par
This proceedings sets out the principles, approach and work of the SMARTHEP network, as presented on 9${}^\text{th}$ May 2023 at CHEP2023.
