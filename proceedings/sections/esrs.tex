\section{Early stage researchers}
\label{esrs}
The primary objective of the network is to train 12 ESRs in the RTA state-of-the-art. These ESRs work with HEP and industry partners throughout\par
e

\subsection{Structure of ESR positions}
\label{esr-structure}
Each ESR is enrolled as a doctoral student at a partner university for 3 years. This university is typically also the primary institution of the ESR, though the industry-centred ESR projects 2 and 10 (discussed in Section~\ref{esr-positions}) are carried out with industry partners near to the university of enrollment. Where partner universities require a longer period of study or typically provide extensions to a 3 year study programme, commitments to further enrollment are provided by each partner university where necessary. At the end of the period of doctoral study, each ESR will receive a doctorate in particle physics from their university of enrollment.\par
ESRs\par


Each ESR will undertake a secondment in HEP during their studies, either at another partner university or a partner research institute. This is generally organised to last for 6 months, though this varies from project to project.\par


In addition to their time working in HEP, each ESR will also spend time working in industry, typically as a secondment of 3-4 months (though this is again flexible to the specific programme of each ESR position).

\subsection{Examples of ESR positions}
\label{esr-examples}
The ESR positions of the network are summarised in Table~\ref{esr-table}.
