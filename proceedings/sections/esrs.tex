\section{Early stage researchers}
\label{esrs}
12 ESRs form the core of the network, with the training and partnerships providing a scaffold for the completion of their respective outcomes. Each ESR is enrolled as a doctoral student at a partner university for 3 years, during which they complete secondments in HEP and industry, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{esr-diagram}. The university of enrolment is generally also the primary institution of the ESR (industry-centred ESR positions are enrolled at a university near to the respective industry partner). A secondment in HEP is undertaken either at another partner university or a partner research institute. Each ESR (with the exception of those in industry-centred positions) also undertakes a secondment in industry, working on an RTA project relevant to their research with an industry partner.\par

Through the combination of primary and secondment work, each ESR will complete goals in HEP (iv.) and industry (v.), discussed in further detail in Section~\ref{goals}. Precise durations of the secondments vary between ESR positions.}

To illustrate further the structure of a SMARTHEP ESR position, a few examples are given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Laura Boggia, one of two industry-centred ESRs, is researching fraud detection at IBM (enrolled at Sorbonne University) using real-time rule induction. A secondment with the CNRS research institute is planned, in which similar techinques will be applied to the classification of HEP observations. 
    \item Carlos Cocha is based at the University of Heidelberg, working on real-time searches for Dark Photons at LHCb, furthered by collaboration with the University of Milano-Bicocca. An industry secondment with Verizon Connect is planned, applying ML expertise to the real-time processing of vehicle data.
    \item Joachim Hansen is developing the real-time calibration of the ALICE Time Projection Chamber, working at Lund University. This commissioning work will be supported by a secondment at CERN. An additional secondment at Ximantis will promote a synergy between industry and HEP applications of ML.
