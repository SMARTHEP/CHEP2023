\section{Early stage researchers}
\label{esrs}
12 ESRs form the core of the network, with the training and partnerships providing a scaffold for the completion of their respective outcomes. These ESRs work with HEP and industry partners throughout the 3 years of their doctoral study.%\par
%Shortly after the commencement of the ESR positions, each ESR supervisor completed a Personal Career Development Plan with their ESR. This document details the 

\subsection{Structure of ESR positions}
\label{esr-structure}
Each ESR is enrolled as a doctoral student at a partner university for 3 years. This university is typically also the primary institution of the ESR (2 industry-centred ESR positions are enrolled at a university near to the respective industry partner). At the end of the period of doctoral study, each ESR will receive a doctorate in particle physics from their university of enrollment.\par

Each ESR will undertake a secondment in HEP during their studies, either at another partner university or a partner research institute. This is generally organised to last for 6 months, though this varies from project to project.\par

In addition to their time working in HEP, each ESR will also spend time working in industry, typically as a secondment of 3-4 months (though this is again flexible to the specific programme of each ESR position).\par
