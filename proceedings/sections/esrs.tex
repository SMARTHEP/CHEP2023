\section{Early stage researchers}
\label{esrs}
The 12 ESRs form the core of the network, with the training and partnerships providing a scaffold for the completion of their respective outcomes. These ESRs work with HEP and industry partners throughout the 3 years of their doctoral study.\par

Shortly after the commencement of the ESR positions, each ESR supervisor completed a Personal Career Development Plan with their ESR. This document details the 

\subsection{Structure of ESR positions}
\label{esr-structure}
Each ESR is enrolled as a doctoral student at a partner university for 3 years. This university is typically also the primary institution of the ESR, though the industry-centred ESR positions 2 and 10 (discussed in Section~\ref{esr-positions}) are carried out with industry partners near to the university of enrollment. Where partner universities require a longer period of study or typically provide extensions to a 3 year study programme, commitments to further enrollment are provided by each partner university where necessary. At the end of the period of doctoral study, each ESR will receive a doctorate in particle physics from their university of enrollment.\par

During the course of their enrolment, they will undertake secondments with network partners in HEP (ii.) and industry (iii.). Through the combination of their primary and secondment work, each ESR will achieve several goals in HEP (iv.) and industry (v.), as discussed in further detail in Section~\ref{goals}.}

Each ESR will undertake a secondment in HEP during their studies, either at another partner university or a partner research institute. This is generally organised to last for 6 months, though this varies from project to project.\par

In addition to their time working in HEP, each ESR will also spend time working in industry, typically as a secondment of 3-4 months (though this is again flexible to the specific programme of each ESR position).

\subsection{Examples of ESR positions}

The 12 ESR positions of the network are summarised in Table~\ref{esr-positions}.\par

To paint a clearer picture of how the positions take shape, a few examples are taken from Table~\ref{esr-positions}. Jamie Gooding (ESR7) is based at Technische Universit√§t Dortmund, working on real-time event selection at the LHCb Experiment, with a HEP secondment of $\approx 6$ months at CERN to support this work and a 3-4 month industry secondment with Ximantis, working on real-time traffic monitoring.
