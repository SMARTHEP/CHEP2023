\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
Through the activities of the network outlined in this contribution, SMARTHEP aims to provide valuable contributions to HEP, industry, and the wider community. By the close of the network in September 2025, the 12 ESRs will be well-equipped to progress their research and their careers. The network will play a key role in the commissioning and operation of major LHC experiments and seek to strengthen experimental RTA portfolios by a two-way sharing of knowledge and expertise with industry partners. Such collaboration between academic and industrial network participants will deepen synergies across the field in the application of RTA.
