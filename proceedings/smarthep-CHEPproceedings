    \textbf{S}ynergies between \textbf{MA}chine learning, \textbf{R}eal-\textbf{T}ime analysis and \textbf{H}ybrid architectures for efficient \textbf{E}vent \textbf{P}rocessing and decision-making (SMARTHEP) is a European Training Network, training a new generation of Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) to advance real-time decision-making, driving data-collection and analysis towards synonymity.

    SMARTHEP brings together scientists from major LHC collaborations at the frontiers of real-time analysis (RTA) and key specialists from computer science and industry. By solving concrete problems as a community, SMARTHEP will further the adoption of RTA techniques, enabling future High Energy Physics (HEP) discoveries and generating impact in industry.

    ESRs will contribute to European growth, leveraging their hands-on experience in machine learning and accelerators towards commercial deliverables in fields that can profit most from RTA, e.g. transport, manufacturing, and finance.

    This contribution presents the training and outreach plan for the network, and is intended as an opportunity for further collaboration and feedback from the CHEP community.
